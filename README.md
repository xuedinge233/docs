# The Doc of Ascend Supported Open Source project

This repository is a collection of documentation for Ascend supported open source projects.

# Structure

- `index.rst`: the index of the opensource project doc.
- `quick_start.rst`: **5 minutes** or **600 words**, quickstarts enable people to quickly complete a discrete, focused task by illustrating a workflow with **only essential steps**. See also in [Github quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/quickstart-content-type).
- `install.rst`: installation guide, including common installation (such as binary, pypi, conda) for developers and a quick installation verification
- `tutorial.rst`: more complex than quickstart, help people learn about **products** and solve **real world problems** by guiding them through **the entire workflow to complete a task**. See also in [Github tutorial guide](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/tutorial-content-type).
- `faq.rst`: A frequently asked questions (FAQ) list.

We use sphinx and rst file to create docs and you need to refer to rst syntax for help.
Here is how you can create a new docs:

1. Create a rst file. You can put it anywhere, but it must be better to classify it.
2. Add the rst into the index.rst

# Building locally

```

2. Building:  

```bash
make html
```

3. Server on localhost:
